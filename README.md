Yggdrasil (aka CBCommonLib)
===========

Yggdrasil - also known as "the tree of life" or "tree of knowledge" in the
Nordic mythology - is a library which contains several utils and tools that can be used
across multiple plugins.

What needs to be done:
======================
* PermissionsProvider
* EconomyProvider
* Block- and RegionProtectionProvider need some more plugins (if any of them fits)
* Maths and cuboid/trigmath utils
* WorldUtil, which extends ChunkUtil which extends BlockUtil. Will allow different operations on worlds/blocks
* NBTUtil, set custom nbt tags on entities and items
* NBTLib needs some converters to vanilla (I will add this later)
* CommonPlayer needs to be finished, will also create a CommonEntity class etc.
* More Refs
* Wrappers
* Chat needs to be done. This will allow one to send fancy messages, making use of the new chat features
* Protocol library needs to be finished
* Handy Thread utils
* Database Utils, MYSQL to SQLite etc. Also easy creation of a database and adding/removing data etc
* DebugCommand; will use some kind of "command scripting language" to debug various stuff on runtime
* ErrorReporter needs to be finished, will allow one to print errors.. Pretty
* TabLib
* Some more things, but these are the most importants.
